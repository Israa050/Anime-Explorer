# 🌸 Anime Explorer App  

A beautifully designed **Flutter mobile app** to explore your favorite **Animes and Characters** 🎌.  
This project focuses on **UI implementation** (no backend logic yet) with a strong emphasis on **clean architecture, modularity, and scalability**.  

---

## ✨ Overview  

- 📱 **Home Page**: Browse a list of animes and characters with smooth bottom navigation.  
- 🎬 **Details Page**: Dive deeper into anime details with a poster, logo, and custom navigation (Preview & Watch).  
- 💎 **Upgrade Plan Page**: Choose between **Monthly** and **Annual** subscription plans.  

This project demonstrates **Clean Architecture** principles and reusable UI components, making it easier to maintain, scale, and add features in the future.

## 🏛️ Architecture  

The project follows **Clean Architecture** principles:  

- **Separation of concerns** → Each layer has a clear responsibility.  
- **Scalability & testability** → Logic and UI are decoupled.  
- **Reusability** → Shared widgets and models can be easily reused.  

### Why Clean Architecture?  
Because it ensures:  
✔ Maintainable codebase  
✔ Modular feature organization  
✔ Easy testing & refactoring  
✔ Professional development standards  

Additionally, I applied **Object-Oriented Design Principles** inspired by *“The OOP Thought Process”* 📘 to structure classes and achieve better **abstraction, encapsulation, and reusability**.
